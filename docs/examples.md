```

### 2. Research and Knowledge Management

**Scenario**: Collecting and organizing research on different technologies.

```bash
# Research Session 1: Database Options
memcord_name "database_research"
memcord_tag add "research database technical decision"
memcord_group set "research/technical"

memcord_save "
Database Research Session

PostgreSQL:
- ACID compliance
- Strong consistency
- Complex queries with joins
- JSON support for flexibility
- Cons: Resource intensive

MongoDB:
- Document-based NoSQL
- Horizontal scaling
- Flexible schema
- Good for rapid development
- Cons: Eventual consistency

Redis:
- In-memory data store
- Excellent for caching
- Pub/sub capabilities
- Very fast reads/writes
- Cons: Data persistence concerns
"

# Research Session 2: Add new findings
memcord_name "database_research"
memcord_save_progress "
Additional research on database performance:

Benchmarks show PostgreSQL handling 10k concurrent connections efficiently.
MongoDB cluster setup requires 3+ nodes for production.
Redis persistence can be configured with AOF + RDB for durability.

Decision factors:
- Data consistency requirements
- Expected query complexity  
- Scaling needs
- Team expertise
" 0.15

# Query your research later
memcord_query "What are the pros and cons of PostgreSQL?"
memcord_query "Which database is best for caching?"
memcord_search "performance" --include-tags "research"
```

### 3. Bug Investigation and Resolution

**Scenario**: Tracking a complex bug investigation across multiple sessions.

```bash
# Initial bug report
memcord_name "auth_bug_investigation"
memcord_tag add "bug critical security authentication"
memcord_group set "bugs/critical"

memcord_save "
Bug Report #1247: Authentication Bypass

Severity: Critical
Reporter: QA Team
Date: 2024-01-15

Description:
Users can access protected routes without valid JWT tokens
Intermittent issue - occurs ~20% of requests

Initial findings:
- Only affects /api/v1/admin/* endpoints
- Token validation middleware seems to fail
- No errors in application logs
- Only happens in production environment

Investigation plan:
1. Review middleware code
2. Check token validation logic
3. Compare prod vs dev configurations
4. Add detailed logging
"

# Investigation session 1
memcord_save_progress "
Investigation Update 1:

Found issue in middleware:
- Race condition in token cache
- Multiple requests clearing cache simultaneously
- Cache miss causes fallback to 'allow' instead of 'deny'

Code review shows:
```javascript
if (!tokenCache.has(token)) {
  // BUG: Default to allow during cache rebuild
  return next(); // Should be 'return res.status(401)'
}
```

Next steps:
- Fix default behavior
- Add proper locking for cache operations
- Increase test coverage for concurrent scenarios
" 0.2

# Resolution session
memcord_save_progress "
Resolution:

1. Fixed middleware default behavior
2. Implemented proper cache locking
3. Added integration tests for concurrent auth
4. Deployed fix to staging - no issues in 48h testing

Code changes:
- middleware/auth.js: Fixed default deny behavior  
- tests/auth.test.js: Added concurrency tests
- monitoring/alerts.js: Added auth failure rate alerts

Status: RESOLVED
Verification: 1000+ production requests with 0% bypass rate

memcord_name "project_alpha_lessons"
memcord_tag add "project alpha lessons architecture"
memcord_group set "projects/alpha/retrospective"

memcord_save "
Project Alpha - Architecture Lessons Learned

Microservices Approach:
‚úÖ Services were well-isolated
‚úÖ Independent deployment worked well
‚ùå Service discovery was complex
‚ùå Cross-service debugging difficult

Technology Choices:
‚úÖ Node.js for rapid development
‚úÖ PostgreSQL for complex queries
‚ùå Should have used TypeScript from start
‚ùå Redis clustering was overkill

Team Process:
‚úÖ Daily standups kept everyone aligned
‚úÖ Code reviews caught many issues
‚ùå Should have done more pair programming
‚ùå Technical debt accumulated quickly
"

# Project Beta planning
memcord_name "project_beta_planning"
memcord_tag add "project beta planning architecture"
memcord_group set "projects/beta/planning"

# Learn from previous project
memcord_query "What lessons were learned about microservices in project alpha?"
memcord_query "What technology choices should we avoid in the new project?"

# Document planning decisions
memcord_save "
Project Beta - Initial Planning

Based on Alpha lessons learned:

Architecture Decisions:
- Start with monolith, extract services later
- Use TypeScript from day 1
- Implement proper service discovery (Consul)
- Plan cross-service debugging strategy

Technology Stack:
- TypeScript + Node.js (proven combo)
- PostgreSQL (continue with what works)
- Simple Redis setup (single instance initially)
- Docker for consistent environments

Process Improvements:
- Implement pair programming sessions
- Weekly technical debt review
- Automated testing before code review
- Architecture decision records (ADRs)

memcord_save "
Authentication Support Guide

Common Issues:

1. 'Invalid credentials' error
   Causes: Wrong email/password, account locked, expired session
   Solution: Verify credentials, check account status, clear browser cache
   
2. 'Token expired' message
   Causes: Session timeout (24h default), server restart
   Solution: Re-login, check 'remember me' option
   
3. Social login failures
   Causes: Third-party service down, permissions changed
   Solution: Try email login, check social platform status

Escalation triggers:
- Multiple users affected (service issue)
- Account appears compromised (security)
- Payment-related auth issues (billing team)
"

# Payment support knowledge
memcord_name "payment_support_kb"
memcord_tag add "support payment billing customer"
memcord_group set "support/billing"

memcord_save "
Payment Support Guide

Common Issues:

1. Card declined
   Causes: Insufficient funds, expired card, bank security
   Solution: Try different card, contact bank, verify billing address
   
2. Subscription not updating
   Causes: Payment processing delay, cache issues
   Solution: Wait 15 minutes, clear cache, check bank statement
   
3. Refund requests
   Process: Verify purchase, check refund policy, process via admin panel
   Timeline: 3-5 business days to original payment method

memcord_group set "decisions/architecture"

memcord_save "
Architecture Decision Record #001: API Versioning Strategy

Status: Accepted
Date: 2024-01-15
Deciders: Engineering Team, Product Team

Context:
We need to establish a consistent API versioning strategy as we add new features and make breaking changes. Current API has no versioning, causing issues when we need to update endpoints.

Decision:
Implement URL path versioning (e.g., /api/v1/, /api/v2/) rather than header or query parameter versioning.

Rationale:
- Clear and explicit version in URL
- Easy to test and document
- Supports browser-based testing
- Widely adopted industry pattern
- Simpler than content negotiation

Alternatives Considered:
1. Header versioning (Accept: application/vnd.api+json;version=1)
   - Rejected: Complex for frontend teams
2. Query parameter (?version=1)
   - Rejected: Easy to omit accidentally
3. Subdomain versioning (v1.api.example.com)
   - Rejected: DNS and SSL complexity

Implementation:
- New endpoints: Start with /api/v1/
- Existing endpoints: Gradually migrate to /api/v1/
- Deprecation: 6-month notice before removing old versions
- Documentation: Version-specific API docs

Consequences:
+ Clear versioning strategy
+ Easier API evolution
+ Better backward compatibility
- Slight URL complexity
- Need migration plan for existing endpoints

Architecture Decision Record #002: Database Migration Tool

Status: Accepted  
Date: 2024-01-20
Deciders: Backend Team, DevOps Team

Context:
Current database changes are applied manually, leading to inconsistencies between environments and deployment issues.

Decision:
Use Flyway for database migration management.

Rationale:
- Version-based migration files
- Automatic tracking of applied migrations
- Support for rollback scenarios
- CI/CD integration capabilities
- Wide PostgreSQL support

Alternatives Considered:
1. Liquibase
   - Rejected: XML configuration complexity
2. Custom migration scripts
   - Rejected: No automatic tracking
3. Prisma Migrate
   - Rejected: Too tightly coupled to ORM

Implementation Plan:
- Baseline current production schema
- Convert existing scripts to Flyway format
- Integrate with CI/CD pipeline
- Team training on migration best practices
