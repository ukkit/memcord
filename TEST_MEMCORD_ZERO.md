# memcord_zero Fix Test

## Issue Description

The `memcord_zero` tool was not working in Claude Desktop. When users typed 'memcord_zero', instead of activating zero mode, it would trigger other memcord tools like `memcord_query`, `memcord_list`, and `memcord_read`.

## Root Cause

The `memcord_zero` tool was missing from the MCP server's `call_tool()` handler in `src/memcord/server.py`. While the tool was properly defined in the tool list and had a handler method, it wasn't included in the main routing logic that processes tool calls from Claude Desktop.

## Fix Applied

Added the missing case to the `call_tool()` handler in `src/memcord/server.py`:

```python
elif name == "memcord_zero":
    return await self._handle_zeromem(arguments)
```

This was inserted at line 556-557, right after the `memcord_compress` handler and before the advanced tools section.

## Fix Verification

The fix has been verified with a comprehensive test suite that covers:

1. ✅ **Tool Registration**: Confirms `memcord_zero` is in the basic tools list
2. ✅ **Tool Activation**: Verifies the tool activates zero mode correctly
3. ✅ **State Management**: Confirms zero mode state is properly set (`__ZERO__` slot)
4. ✅ **Save Blocking**: Ensures `memcord_save` and `memcord_save_progress` are blocked
5. ✅ **User Feedback**: Confirms helpful messages are shown in zero mode
6. ✅ **List Display**: Verifies `memcord_list` shows zero mode warning
7. ✅ **Exit Mechanism**: Tests that `memcord_name [slot]` exits zero mode
8. ✅ **Normal Operation**: Confirms saves work again after exiting zero mode

## Running the Test

To run the comprehensive test:

```bash
uv run python test_memcord_zero_fix.py
```

## Expected Behavior

After the fix, when users type 'memcord_zero' in Claude Desktop:

1. **Zero mode activates immediately** - No other tools are triggered
2. **Clear feedback is provided** - Users see the zero mode activation message
3. **Save operations are blocked** - With helpful guidance on how to resume
4. **Easy exit** - Users can use `memcord_name [slot_name]` to resume saving
5. **Normal operation resumes** - All functionality works after exiting zero mode

## Privacy Benefits

The `memcord_zero` tool provides important privacy controls:

- **Sensitive conversations**: Ensure private discussions aren't saved
- **Testing scenarios**: Prevent test conversations from polluting memory
- **Guest access**: Allow others to use Claude without saving their data
- **Temporary usage**: Use Claude without building permanent memory

## Technical Details

- **Zero mode state**: Managed by setting `current_slot = "__ZERO__"`
- **Save blocking**: Both manual saves and auto-summaries are blocked
- **User guidance**: Helpful messages guide users on how to resume
- **Session persistence**: Zero mode stays active until explicitly changed
